Everything happens for a reason. Both the arrival and departure of those moments and feeling have reasons to visit us. What follows is, we need to find a reason for them to leave us.</p>
<p>It’s not always possible to fight the direct cause of the problem, as it’s not always so apparent, or reverse time to prevent whatever happened to us if we already know what’s the problem. Therefore it’s valuable to know what to do in the situations when there’s nothing else we can do besides moving on.</p>
<p>Not the easiest task, especially when we already sank deep. Let me try to help you. What I’m about to tell you helped me in bad times. I hope that you’ll find it somewhat valuable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t make your bedroom your all-room and the flat your world. </em></strong>Go for a walk, do the groceries or read a book somewhere on the square of your city. Closing up in your room is essentially closing up with negative thoughts. It’s like putting ducktape on your brain’s mouth screaming for dopamine.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduce your screen-time. </strong>Phones are a huge stone tied to our legs, they can make us sink deeper than ever. Not only that they can keep you sitting at home, but they can also remind you of thing you don’t want to remember. Also, the distraction they offer is only temporary. We are looking for a long-term solution here. Don’t touch them in the morning after waking up neither before going to sleep. It will help you with the third point</li>
<li>
<strong>Have a sleep routine. </strong>Destabilising your sleep is one of the causes of mental sicknesses. With no exceptions, we all need regular sleep. It takes about three days to establish such routine but only one night to destroy the effort. But, if you succeed at it, your brain will thank you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Have smart goals to continue your journey as a stronger person.</strong> If you are really planning onto getting better you should know what to do next. Every traveller needs a map on his/her journey, just as you need a plan. Just bear in mind to plan your goals according to the acronym at the end of the article. Having plans that are unable to be accomplished is a way to make us feel miserable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Last one. Don’t expect to be happy 100% of the time. Nobody is perfect. </strong>There isn’t a single person on this planet that is only happy and never sad. Life is composed of good and bad moments. It’s up to you to always enjoy the good ones and not don’t give up once you encounter a bad one.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish you all the best. Here’s the acronym for your new life goals:</p>
